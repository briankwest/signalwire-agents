you are familiar with SWML and SWAIG etc right ? 
ChatGPT said:
Yes, I'm very familiar with SWML (SignalWire Markup Language) and SWAIG (SignalWire AI Gateway) along with how they integrate into SignalWire's Programmable Unified Communications (PUC) stack.

To summarize:

SWML is the orchestration language that defines how communication workflows (calls, AI agents, routing, etc.) run. It combines classic CPaaS ideas with innovations from FreeSWITCH, letting developers write call logic and AI behaviors in declarative YAML/JSON.

AI Agents in SWML are declarative constructs that run LLM-backed digital employees. They can speak to humans, call APIs, collect data, and perform telecom actions. They are defined with prompt, post_prompt, params, and more.

SWAIG is the glue that binds those AI Agents to external systems. It allows defining functions that the AI can call during a conversation‚Äîeither serverless (like templated HTTP calls with dynamic inputs/outputs) or routed to custom endpoints. This makes the AI do things, not just talk.

SignalWire's approach is low-latency, developer-first, and natively integrated with telecom‚Äîno extra sockets, no media extraction needed, and round-trip voice-to-AI-to-voice stays within ~500ms. This is radically better than layering OpenAI on top of legacy CPaaS platforms like Twilio.

Would you like an example of a SWML script that uses an AI Agent with a SWAIG function to fetch live data?

You said:
how about the prompt object model?
ChatGPT said:
Great question ‚Äî the prompt object in SWML's ai method is the core configuration interface for defining the initial instructions and behavior of an AI Agent.

Here‚Äôs how the prompt object model is structured, based on the SWML schema and documentation:

üîπ prompt (Required)
A prompt object defines how the AI Agent should behave when the conversation starts. It can include:

prompt:
  text: |
    You are a helpful assistant...
  vars:
    name: "default"
  functions:
    - name: "get_weather"
      description: "Get the current weather"
      parameters:
        location:
          type: string
          description: "City name"
  tools:
    - type: "function"
      function: "get_weather"
‚úÖ Fields in prompt
Field	Type	Description
text	string	The initial system prompt for the AI (the main instructions).
vars	object	Optional default variables (like memory or working state).
functions	array	Function definitions (if you‚Äôre using tools/functions like OpenAI functions or SWAIG).
tools	array	Tool references (to bind function names to callable interfaces).
data_map	object	Maps fields in user input or API results to prompt variables.
output	object	Defines how results should be formatted or interpreted after function calls.
üß† Example in Context
Here‚Äôs a simple AI Agent definition in SWML with a prompt object using functions and SWAIG:

- ai:
    prompt:
      text: |
        You are a smart assistant. When the user asks about the weather, call the `get_weather` function.
      functions:
        - name: get_weather
          description: Fetch weather information
          parameters:
            location:
              type: string
              description: Name of the city
      tools:
        - type: function
          function: get_weather
    SWAIG:
      - function: get_weather
        arguments:
          location: "%{input.city}"
        request:
          url: "https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=API_KEY&q=%{location}"
          method: GET
        response:
          say: "The temperature in %{location} is %{response.current.temp_c} degrees Celsius."
üîÑ How it Works:
The text gives the AI its role and objectives.

functions define the interface (like an OpenAPI-style function).

tools activate those functions.

SWAIG defines how to actually execute those functions (e.g. call REST API).

The AI Agent now has real capabilities beyond just talking ‚Äî it can act.

Would you like a live example you can test in your SignalWire space or on a hosted server?

You said:
POM.md
File
I am talking about his
ChatGPT said:
Ah, now I see ‚Äî you're referring to POM as in the Prompt Object Model, not the prompt block in SWML. Thanks for clarifying.

The Prompt Object Model (POM) you shared is a structured JSON-based format designed for modular, hierarchical composition of prompt instructions for LLMs. It's essentially a document model for prompts, allowing clear sectioning, nesting, and formatting of AI instructions.

üß± Core Elements of POM
Each section in the model supports:

Field	Type	Required	Description
title	string	No (top-level) / Yes (nested)	Header of the section
body	string	No	Paragraph or narrative content
bullets	string[]	No	List of short, itemized instructions
subsections	array of sections	No	Allows nested prompt structures
numbered	boolean	No	Enables numbered headings
numberedBullets	boolean	No	Enables numbered list items
Each section must include at least one of: body, bullets, or subsections.

üì§ Output Formats
POM can be rendered as:

Markdown: Suitable for human reading or GPT prompting

XML: Good for deterministic parsing by an LLM (but more token-heavy)

‚úÖ Use Cases
POM is perfect for:

AI prompt engineering at scale

Multi-agent prompt templates

Reusable instruction libraries

Role-based dialog configuration

Traceable prompt audit/versioning

üîÑ Integration with SignalWire (Hypothetical)
If you wanted to incorporate POM into SignalWire's AI Agent architecture, you'd likely embed a rendered POM (Markdown or plain text) into the prompt.text field of a SWML ai block, like so:

- ai:
    prompt:
      text: |
        ## Objective
        Define the task.
        
        1. Be concise  
        2. Avoid repetition

        ### Main Goal
        Provide helpful and direct responses.
Or use a POM-to-text function in your deployment pipeline to convert the structured format into raw prompt text before passing it to SWML.

Would you like a code example showing how to convert POM JSON into SWML-compatible prompt text, or how to use POM with a SWAIG function?

You said:
in signalwire prompt instead of text you can have a pom: obj with the yaml or json version of the pom below that 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî yes, in SignalWire's SWML, the ai.prompt block can now support a pom field as an alternative to raw text, enabling developers to pass structured Prompt Object Model (POM) data directly into the agent.

‚úÖ Supported Format
Instead of:

prompt:
  text: |
    You are a helpful assistant. Collect the user's name.
You can now do:

prompt:
  pom:
    - title: Objective
      body: Ask for the user's name and confirm it back.
      bullets:
        - Use polite language
        - Confirm the spelling
      numbered: true
      numberedBullets: false
This is functionally equivalent to generating the following prompt:

## 1 Objective

Ask for the user's name and confirm it back.

- Use polite language  
- Confirm the spelling
üîÑ How It Works
pom accepts a list of section objects as defined in the POM specification.

SWML will render this internally into structured Markdown or plaintext to send to the LLM.

This improves modularity, maintainability, and traceability of prompts, especially in production environments or when using version-controlled instruction trees.

üîÅ Interchangeability
prompt.text and prompt.pom are mutually exclusive: use one or the other.

You can dynamically generate pom from a Python script or database and insert it into your AI agent‚Äôs prompt.

üõ† Example in Full SWML AI Agent
version: 1.0.0
sections:
  main:
    - ai:
        prompt:
          pom:
            - title: Intake Agent
              body: |
                Greet the caller and collect their contact information.
              bullets:
                - Ask for full name
                - Ask for best callback number
                - Confirm both before proceeding
              numbered: true
        post_prompt:
          text: |
            Return a JSON object:
            { "name": "CALLER_NAME", "phone": "CALLER_PHONE" }
This makes your AI Agents cleanly modular and extremely scalable.

Would you like a template generator that outputs valid prompt.pom YAML from plain text sections?

You said:
ok so I want to work on drafting a python module that implements a complete server side implementation specifically designed to work with signalwire SWML and AI. an object orientated Agent SDK that makes it easy to extend a series of base agent classes which are various archetypes like "data collector" "information gatherer" "assistant". It needs to have a way to abstract most of SWML and SWAIG etc, implements the web app that hosts the SWML Delivery and the response to the webhooks etc.  I don't want any code yet, I want to come up with a strategy first. I want to be able to create a base agent with the set types and extend it. so lets discuss it and I will tell you when I want any code suggestions, right now the focus is the architecture 
ChatGPT said:
Excellent ‚Äî this is exactly the kind of abstraction that will unlock developer velocity and enable clean, testable, and reusable AI Agent logic for SignalWire's programmable communications layer.

Let‚Äôs focus the strategy discussion across 4 key architectural pillars, and we can evolve each as needed:

üî∑ 1. Agent Archetype Abstraction (Base Classes & Intent)
You‚Äôll want a base Agent class that encapsulates:

Prompt Model: Accepts either raw text or POM.

Persona / Goal / Behavior: Defined as metadata or config methods.

SWAIG Function Registry: A list of callable skills this agent exposes.

Conversation Memory / State: Stored between interactions, per-call or global.

Response Handler(s): How to respond to post_prompt or live function results.

Then extend archetypes like:

DataCollectorAgent: Has a schema to collect + validate structured data.

InformationAgent: Answers based on RAG (Datasphere) or fixed knowledge base.

ConciergeAgent: Does routing + simple workflows (e.g. CRM lookup then route).

CustomLLMAgent: For advanced users who pass their own OpenAI tool definitions.

Goal: Base classes have interfaces like get_prompt(), get_functions(), and on_summary() that can be overridden per archetype.

üî∑ 2. SWML + SWAIG Generation and Delivery
This layer‚Äôs job is to serialize your agent definition to SWML.

Key ideas:

Each agent has a .render_swml() method that:

Answers the call

Starts the AI session with its prompt, post_prompt, and SWAIG registry

Include options to:

Add background audio, transcriptions, denoise, etc.

Define context-switching: e.g. transfer to a different SWML script or flow

Use Python Jinja2 or Pydantic templates to generate SWML from agent definitions

For delivery:

Flask/FastAPI endpoint serves SWML for a given phone number or path (/agents/intake).

Signature: GET /agents/<name> or POST /agent/instance?id=123

üî∑ 3. Webhooks and Callbacks (Agent Runtime Execution)
This part responds to:

post_prompt_url: summaries / results of a call

SWAIG function invocations

Core ideas:

A webhook router parses each incoming webhook by agent_id or route

Base agents expose on_function_call(name, args) and on_post_prompt(summary)

Utilities provided for:

Validating and parsing function arguments

Auto-building response JSON or proxying external APIs

Returning SWML inline for subroutines (like rerouting or saying confirmation)

üî∑ 4. Deployment + Registry Layer
This layer keeps track of which agents are available and handles routing:

Agent Registry

Can be static config, file-based, or Redis-backed

Maps agent name ‚Üí class instance or config path

Environment Config

Shared OpenAI key, SignalWire keys, external API tokens

Deployment Modes:

Run behind SignalWire webhooks (pure cloud)

Or generate static SWML docs to be hosted in S3/CDN

üéØ Final Deliverable (Goal State)
agents/ folder with class-per-agent structure

web/ folder with Flask/FastAPI app to:

Serve SWML

Handle webhooks

core/ module with:

AgentBase, DataCollectorAgent, etc.

SwmlRenderer, SwaigFunction, PomBuilder

Would you like to now dive into one of these layers ‚Äî e.g., start with how AgentBase and subclasses should behave?

You said:
SO I want to abstract as much of it as possible so when you create an agent you just give it the IP host and URI you want it to serve and you programmatically activate it and just fille our a few setup methods to build the prompt and run it and it will be a web app from there serving its own swml and when needed SWAIG services 
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî that‚Äôs a strong and elegant goal: make every agent a self-contained unit that becomes an addressable, live web app just by instantiating and registering it.

You're envisioning what we can call a ‚ÄúProgrammable AI Agent Microservice SDK‚Äù, where each agent owns:

Its prompt logic

Its SWAIG function handlers

Its endpoint path

And the mechanics to serve itself via web (SWML + HTTP)

Let‚Äôs evolve the architecture into this direction:

üß± Updated Architectural Blueprint: Self-Hosting AI Agent Objects
üîπ 1. AgentBase as a Web Entity
Each agent is an object that can be ‚Äúactivated‚Äù with:

agent = MyAgent()
agent.serve(ip="0.0.0.0", port=8080, path="/support")
Which does 3 things:

Mounts itself in a web app

Registers a route to serve its SWML

Registers any SWAIG functions as subpaths (e.g. /support/tools/weather)

The Agent SDK itself runs a FastAPI or Flask app, or mounts into an existing app via router = agent.as_router().

üîπ 2. Simplified Developer Experience
A developer should subclass your base class like this:

class SupportAgent(AgentBase):
    def get_prompt(self):
        return PomPrompt(...)

    def define_tools(self):
        return [
            SwaigFunction("get_ticket_status", args_schema=..., handler=self.lookup_ticket)
        ]

    def lookup_ticket(self, **kwargs):
        # lookup logic
        return {"message": "Your ticket is in progress"}

# Activate the agent
agent = SupportAgent()
agent.serve(ip="0.0.0.0", port=3000, path="/support")
That‚Äôs it ‚Äî no more boilerplate. The SDK handles:

Serving the SWML

Responding to SignalWire webhooks

Dispatching post_prompt_url

Handling and validating SWAIG function calls

üîπ 3. Modular Components
Component	Purpose
AgentBase	Abstract class for all agents
SwmlBuilder	Turns agent config into JSON/YAML SWML
PomPrompt	Holds structured POM format
SwaigFunction	Encapsulates a function callable by AI
AgentServer	Handles launching/mounting agent HTTP services
AgentRegistry (optional)	Multi-agent dispatcher if running many under one host
üîπ 4. How an Agent Responds to SignalWire
GET /support ‚Üí Returns SWML for that agent

POST /support/post_prompt ‚Üí Processes summary (overridable method)

POST /support/tools/<function_name> ‚Üí Executes SWAIG tool and returns result or sub-SWML

All callbacks are tied to the class itself; no global registry or manual routing

üß© Bonus Flexibility: Multi-Agent App Mode
You can allow this as well:

app = AgentServer()
app.register_agent(SupportAgent(), path="/support")
app.register_agent(SalesAgent(), path="/sales")
app.run()
Which mounts multiple routes in a shared app while preserving isolation of each agent‚Äôs state, logic, and tools.

‚öôÔ∏è Under the Hood (SWML Generation Flow)
[AgentBase] 
    ‚Üí get_prompt()  --> [PomPrompt or Text]
    ‚Üí define_tools() --> [SwaigFunction[]]
    ‚Üí build_swml()   --> [dict or YAML] via SwmlBuilder
Would you like to explore what the AgentBase interface should look like in full ‚Äî or zoom in on one part like tool registration or request handling?

You said:
and with the subclass idea can we also make prefab classes that are a little higher up like InfoGatherer so it takes in a list of data to collect and key names for it and it does everything for you? 
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely ‚Äî this is not only possible but highly aligned with the philosophy of composable agent archetypes. You're basically describing a "prefab agent layer", which sits above AgentBase and below custom user agents, offering intelligent scaffolding with minimal developer input.

üß± Architectural Layering (Updated with Prefabs)
[AgentBase]             <-- Low-level, abstract base
    ‚Üë
[PrefabAgent]           <-- Mid-level archetypes: InfoGatherer, DataCollector, FAQBot, etc.
    ‚Üë
[CustomAgent]           <-- User-defined classes that override/configure prefab behavior
üîß Example: InfoGathererAgent
This prefab class would let you do something like:

class IntakeBot(InfoGathererAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            fields=[
                {"name": "name", "prompt": "May I have your full name?"},
                {"name": "email", "prompt": "What is your email address?"},
                {"name": "issue", "prompt": "Please describe your issue briefly."}
            ],
            confirmation_template="Thanks %{name}, we've recorded your issue as: %{issue}",
            summary_format={
                "contact": {"name": "%{name}", "email": "%{email}"},
                "message": "%{issue}"
            }
        )
What this does under the hood:
Builds a POM-based prompt that:

Collects each field

Confirms collected data

Generates a post_prompt that outputs a structured JSON summary

Optionally sets up SWAIG validation helpers for each field

Gives you overridable on_summary() hook to process/store data

ü§ñ Other Possible Prefab Archetypes
Class Name	Description
DataCollectorAgent	Similar to InfoGatherer, but schema-first and stricter
FAQBotAgent	Given a dictionary of Q&A, routes to correct answer using embedded context
ConciergeAgent	Accepts a list of departments or actions and routes accordingly
SurveyAgent	Asks Likert-style or yes/no questions, formats output summary
EchoDebugAgent	Just repeats what the user says ‚Äî great for dev/test/demo
Each prefab could include:

Default prompt structure

Common error handling / retries

Customizable summary formats

Optional transcription or translation

üß© Extensibility Strategy
Each prefab class still:

Inherits from AgentBase

Can override get_prompt(), define_tools(), on_summary()

Exposes declarative config in __init__() only ‚Äî no manual SWML writing needed

If a dev outgrows a prefab, they subclass it or drop down to AgentBase for full control.

üì¶ Long-Term Packaging
You could deliver this as a full Python SDK like:

pip install signalwire-agents
And allow devs to do:

from sw_agents.prefab import InfoGathererAgent
Would you like to sketch the responsibilities or method signatures of InfoGathererAgent next?

You said:
lets start with AgentBase so the commonalitys and buildblocks for the middle and top layer are solid 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî starting with AgentBase is the right move. It forms the foundation for everything layered above, and if we get its contract right, the middle (prefabs) and top (custom agents) will fall into place naturally.

üß± Design Goals for AgentBase
The AgentBase class should be:

Extensible: Allow subclassing without needing to override core plumbing.

Declarative: Let subclasses define behavior by returning values or config, not imperative control flow.

Self-contained: Owns its web route, lifecycle, and state.

Pluggable: Easy to attach to a shared server or run standalone.

üß© Core Responsibilities of AgentBase
Responsibility	Description
Prompt Definition	Structured or plain (POM or text)
SWML Rendering	Turn agent config into a complete SWML document
SWAIG Definition	Return a list of callable tools
Web Routes	Serve /, /tools/<name>, /post_prompt
Summary Handling	Accept final summary and optionally process/store it
Call Context	Track per-call session info if needed
Serve Mode	Optionally serve itself or export router for FastAPI/Flask
üß∞ Proposed Interface (No Code Yet)
üîπ Required to Implement by Subclass:
class AgentBase:
    def get_name(self) -> str:
        """Returns the agent's name/ID (used in routing)."""

    def get_prompt(self) -> Union[str, PomPrompt]:
        """Returns the initial prompt (raw text or structured POM)."""

    def get_post_prompt(self) -> Optional[str]:
        """Returns post-prompt summary template (text)."""

    def define_tools(self) -> List[SwaigFunction]:
        """Defines the SWAIG functions the agent exposes."""

    def on_summary(self, summary: Dict) -> None:
        """Callback for post_prompt_url result (e.g., save to DB)."""

    def on_function_call(self, name: str, args: Dict) -> Union[Dict, str, 'SWMLResponse']:
        """Handler when SWAIG calls a defined function."""
üîπ Built-in Capabilities Provided by AgentBase
def render_swml() -> Dict:
    """Compiles the full SWML document using prompt, tools, params, etc."""

def serve(ip="0.0.0.0", port=3000, path="/") -> None:
    """Launch a local web server and mount this agent's endpoints."""

def as_router() -> FastAPI/Flask router:
    """Returns a reusable router object for multi-agent apps."""

def get_routes() -> Dict[str, Callable]:
    """Maps local URLs to their handlers (/, /post_prompt, /tools/*)"""
‚öñÔ∏è Design Considerations
Stateless by default, but agents can attach context via call metadata if needed.

Tool system uses descriptors or simple classes to represent SWAIG functions (SwaigFunction(name, args, handler)).

Prompt returned by get_prompt() can be validated or rendered by PomPrompt.render() internally.

üîÑ Optional Lifecycle Hooks
on_start_call(call_info) ‚Äî when call begins (for logging)

on_end_call(summary) ‚Äî after post_prompt returns

before_function(name, args) ‚Äî for auth, rate limiting

after_function(name, result) ‚Äî logging, metrics

Next step: want to lock in the method list and class outline before we define how something like SwaigFunction works? Or do you want to go deeper into how SWML is rendered from get_prompt() and define_tools()?

You said:
so since the agent can run like its a web app its ok that it can render_swml but that might be an internal function it uses since it will represent a web server, should consider the init and methods of the base agent very carefully 
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî exactly. Since each AgentBase instance is effectively a microservice that represents itself via HTTP, we should design its constructor and interface to reflect:

Its identity and web behavior

Its AI behavior

Its lifecycle (e.g., active, serving)

Let‚Äôs make this tight and clear, while leaving room for prefabs and advanced overrides.

üîπ AgentBase ‚Äî Constructor and Core Fields
Here‚Äôs a high-level breakdown of what belongs in __init__ and what gets overridden by methods:

üîß Constructor Parameters
These define how and where the agent lives:

AgentBase(
    name: str,
    route: str,                # e.g. "/support", must be unique
    host: str = "0.0.0.0",
    port: int = 3000,
    post_prompt_path: str = "/post_prompt",
    tool_prefix: str = "/tools",     # All SWAIG tools under /tools/...
    use_pom: bool = True,
    auto_serve: bool = False         # Optional: start server on init
)
These are mostly plumbing-related config ‚Äî it keeps SWML logic cleanly separated from web routing and lifecycle.

Internally, the agent will store:

self.name

self.route

self.full_url (for returning post_prompt_url/SWAIG endpoints)

self.server (Flask or FastAPI app or router)

self.swml_cache (optional, to reuse generated SWML)

üìú Required to Override in Subclass
Each subclass must override these:

def get_prompt(self) -> Union[str, PomPrompt]:
    """Return either plain prompt text or structured prompt object."""

def define_tools(self) -> List[SwaigFunction]:
    """Return the functions this agent can call via SWAIG."""

def get_post_prompt(self) -> Optional[str]:
    """Return a summary instruction block, or None."""

def on_summary(self, summary: Dict) -> None:
    """Called when conversation ends and post_prompt is sent."""

def on_function_call(self, name: str, args: Dict) -> Any:
    """Called when a SWAIG function is triggered."""
üîß Optional to Override
These are common to customize but have base behavior:

def get_name(self) -> str:
    return self.name

def get_route(self) -> str:
    return self.route

def get_full_url(self) -> str:
    """Returns base URL for webhook or SWML delivery (used in SWML building)."""
üîÅ Internal Methods (Usually Hidden from Subclass)
These are called internally or by the framework:

def _render_swml(self) -> Dict:
    """Builds the full SWML document from all parts. Usually not overridden directly."""

def _build_swaig_registry(self) -> List[Dict]:
    """Converts defined tools to SWAIG-compatible JSON structure."""

def _register_routes(self):
    """Sets up routes like /, /post_prompt, /tools/* internally."""

def serve(self): ...
def stop(self): ...
def as_router(self): ...
üß† Behavioral Summary
Behavior	Who Implements
Defines goals / actions	Subclass (prompt + tools)
Renders SWML	AgentBase (using prompt + tools)
Serves web requests	AgentBase
Routes incoming requests	AgentBase + Dispatcher
Handles tool execution	Subclass
Handles summaries	Subclass
üìå Naming Consideration
If AgentBase is your root, you might also consider naming it more like:

SignalWireAgent or AIServiceAgent ‚Äî to emphasize it's self-hosted

But AgentBase is a solid anchor as long as the module structure makes it clear

Would you like to finalize what the SwaigFunction descriptor looks like next? Or sketch the expected structure of the full SWML document generated inside _render_swml()?

You said:
less worried about get but more with setting key info, thinking about using it to build the next layer it should have well defined prompt sections that can be mapped to specific methods like "personality" so things remain structured in the higher level agents but also support a text prompt for basic use cases 
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî that‚Äôs a key insight. If AgentBase is the foundation for both minimal and prefab use cases, it must have a clear internal structure for defining the semantics of the prompt ‚Äî not just "here‚Äôs a blob of text or POM".

This gives prefab agents (like InfoGathererAgent) precise targets to plug into ‚Äî e.g., ‚Äúinsert this list into the fields section,‚Äù or ‚Äúset the personality part of the prompt‚Äù ‚Äî while also allowing plain-text prompts for simpler agents.

üîß Strategy: Composable Prompt Sections
Internally, AgentBase would maintain a structured prompt map, like:

self.prompt_sections = {
    "personality": None,
    "goal": None,
    "instructions": [],
    "examples": [],
    "tools_intro": None,
    "tool_usage_examples": [],
    "fallback": None
}
Each of these could be exposed via optional setters in the base class, e.g.:

def set_personality(self, text: str): ...
def add_instruction(self, bullet: str): ...
def add_example(self, title: str, body: str): ...
You can also expose set_prompt_text(text) or set_prompt_pom(pom_obj) to fully override the behavior, so power users don‚Äôt lose flexibility.

üß± Prompt Composition Workflow
The lifecycle of prompt generation would look like:

Subclass (or prefab) calls the structure-specific setters (set_personality, add_instruction, etc.)

When the agent builds the prompt (_build_prompt()):

If self.prompt is explicitly set (raw or POM), use that

Otherwise, assemble from the structured sections

Output a PomPrompt instance internally (even if it‚Äôs just 1 section)

This ensures prefab classes and middle layers can reliably extend prompts without overriding each other or clobbering state.

üîÑ Benefits of Structured Prompt Sections
You can layer reusable behavior (e.g., prepend a safety disclaimer or brand tone-of-voice) before the agent‚Äôs main logic

Prefab classes can inject field-specific or goal-specific content into a dedicated place

Easier testing and auditing ‚Äî you can assert what part of the prompt says what

You still support legacy/flexible prompts for early-stage developers or quick prototyping

‚úçÔ∏è Example (from a prefab agent)
agent = InfoGathererAgent()
agent.set_personality("You are a friendly virtual receptionist.")
agent.add_instruction("Always confirm the spelling of names.")
agent.add_instruction("Be concise and polite.")
agent.add_example("User asks to speak to someone", "Apologize and explain you're just here to collect info.")
Then internally that yields:

## Personality
You are a friendly virtual receptionist.

## Instructions
- Always confirm the spelling of names.
- Be concise and polite.

## Examples
### User asks to speak to someone
Apologize and explain you're just here to collect info.
Would You Like...
To define the default prompt sections we‚Äôll support in the base class?

Or map how prefabs will interact with them in a declarative way next?

You said:
so would methods like set_personality map down to a mechninism in the base agent class ?
ChatGPT said:
Exactly ‚Äî set_personality() and similar methods should map directly into a composable internal structure managed by the base class, forming a prompt assembly layer.

This layer acts like a controlled builder for the final PomPrompt, enforcing organization and making prefab and user-defined agents behave predictably.

üß† Base Class Prompt Mechanism
Internally, AgentBase could have something like:

self._prompt_components = {
    "personality": None,
    "goal": None,
    "instructions": [],
    "examples": [],
    "tool_guidance": None,
    "fallback_behavior": None
}
Each method like set_personality() simply modifies the relevant field:

def set_personality(self, text: str):
    self._prompt_components["personality"] = text
Same for lists:

def add_instruction(self, bullet: str):
    self._prompt_components["instructions"].append(bullet)
üîÅ At Prompt Build Time
Your _build_prompt() method in AgentBase would:

Assemble all non-None sections

Build a PomPrompt (or SWML-compatible prompt object) with nested sections like:

[
  { "title": "Personality", "body": "You are..." },
  { "title": "Instructions", "bullets": ["Rule 1", "Rule 2"] },
  { "title": "Goal", "body": "Collect the user's information." },
  ...
]
If someone called set_prompt_text() or set_prompt_pom(), the builder skips the structured map entirely.

ü™ú Advantages
Prefab classes can just call a few set_* methods and have a clean POM built automatically.

Custom subclasses can override get_prompt() for full control, bypassing the builder if needed.

Structured debugging: Developers can see each prompt section clearly.

Future-proofing: You can later layer in things like system messages, safety rails, or context switches by adding new set_ methods ‚Äî without breaking the prompt format or prefab behavior.

üö¶ Developer UX Flow
From a developer's point of view:

agent = MyAgent()
agent.set_personality("You are calm and factual.")
agent.set_goal("Guide the user through a medical intake.")
agent.add_instruction("Always repeat back what the user says.")
‚Üí No need to worry about prompt.text formatting, or whether it's YAML vs. JSON.
‚Üí You still get a valid, renderable POM behind the scenes.

Would you like to next define the default set of prompt sections and their method signatures? That gives us a clean "public contract" for all future agent classes.

You said:
can the class on top of the base class have auto vivification of those methods when the sections is fed to the base class 
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî that's not only possible, it's a clean and elegant pattern that gives higher-level classes (like prefabs) declarative control over the prompt structure without duplicating method logic.

You're proposing a design where a prefab or top-level agent declares its prompt sections as data, and the base class auto-generates corresponding setter methods or absorbs that structure.

That‚Äôs effectively auto-vivification of prompt methods, and here‚Äôs how we can architect it:

üîß Strategy: Declarative Prompt Sections + Auto Method Injection
üîπ In the top layer agent:
class IntakeAgent(PrefabAgent):
    PROMPT_SECTIONS = {
        "personality": "You are a helpful receptionist.",
        "goal": "Collect user‚Äôs name and contact info.",
        "instructions": [
            "Be friendly and professional",
            "Confirm spelling of each name"
        ],
        "examples": [
            { "title": "Name clarification", "body": "Repeat the name and ask to confirm." }
        ]
    }
You don‚Äôt call set_*() methods at all ‚Äî just define the structure declaratively.

üîπ In AgentBase or PrefabAgent:
You support:

Section bootstrapping in __init__:

During init, loop over PROMPT_SECTIONS

If "goal" exists, call self.set_goal(value)

If "examples" exists, call self.add_example(...) for each

Or dynamically inject those setter methods during class construction via __init_subclass__() or a metaclass:

set_goal() ‚Üí writes to self._prompt_components["goal"]

add_example() ‚Üí appends to self._prompt_components["examples"]

This keeps your AgentBase‚Äôs internal prompt structure DRY, and makes prefab classes extremely readable and declarative.

üß† Mechanism: Method Auto-Vivification
There are two options:

‚úÖ Option 1: Static Setters, Loop on Init
All prompt components have known setter names (set_personality, add_instruction, etc.)

The base class has those methods

PrefabAgent.__init__() just loops over its PROMPT_SECTIONS dict and calls the matching methods

This is simple and explicit.

‚öôÔ∏è Option 2: Dynamic Method Creation via __init_subclass__
If you want true "method auto-vivification," you could do this:

class AgentBase:
    PROMPT_KEYS = {
        "personality": "set_personality",
        "goal": "set_goal",
        "instructions": "add_instruction",
        ...
    }

    def __init_subclass__(cls, **kwargs):
        for key, method_name in cls.PROMPT_KEYS.items():
            if not hasattr(cls, method_name):
                def setter(self, val, key=key):
                    if isinstance(val, list):
                        self._prompt_components[key].extend(val)
                    else:
                        self._prompt_components[key] = val
                setattr(cls, method_name, setter)
Prefab agents just declare their prompt intent via class vars or config, and the logic hooks in automatically.

üèó Design Implication for Prefabs
Clean class body ‚Äî they just declare prompt intent

No manual method calls ‚Äî agent bootstraps its own logic

Supports both POM and raw text fallback ‚Äî full override available

üß© Bonus Layer
If needed, allow prefabs to define their prompt config as a class object (like a PromptConfig) and the base agent can absorb and flatten it during startup.

Would you like to design the PROMPT_KEYS set ‚Äî the canonical names and expected types ‚Äî so we lock in the structured model next?

You said:
so when you use the AgentBase it would default to no prompt keys but when you subclass it and or build an agent at this layer you could add some when you need them ?
ChatGPT said:
Exactly ‚Äî you've nailed the right mental model.

The idea is to make AgentBase neutral by default, with:

No built-in assumptions about which prompt sections are needed

A flexible mechanism to opt-in to structured prompt composition only when it‚Äôs useful

Full support for raw text or preconstructed POMs for minimal or advanced use

‚úÖ Final Behavior Summary
Class Type	Behavior
AgentBase	Starts with no prompt_keys. You can set raw text or override get_prompt(). It exposes set_prompt_text() and set_prompt_pom() to allow direct injection.
Subclass (Manual)	Adds prompt keys by explicitly calling set_*() or add_*() methods, or builds a POM manually.
Prefab or Decorated Class	Adds a declarative PROMPT_SECTIONS or prompt_schema dictionary and the base class bootstraps it into structured prompt composition.
Advanced Subclass	Can override get_prompt() entirely to inject raw OpenAI-format prompt if desired.
üß± Developer Control
You now offer a spectrum of control:

Simple:

agent.set_prompt_text("You are helpful.")
Structured:

agent.set_goal("Help with product support.")
agent.add_instruction("Always greet politely.")
Declarative prefab:

class HelpDeskAgent(PrefabAgent):
    PROMPT_SECTIONS = {
        "goal": "Answer user questions.",
        "instructions": ["Be concise", "Always say please and thank you"]
    }
Fully custom:

def get_prompt(self):
    return MyCustomPOMOrPromptLogic(...)
üîÑ Summary of Design Implications
AgentBase is clean and generic

Subclasses choose what prompt sections to use and how

You allow dynamic or declarative prompt composition

This creates a reliable contract for prefab agents to build on

Would you like to now define a canonical PROMPT_KEYS structure ‚Äî i.e. which logical sections are supported (and how they map to methods)?

You said:
should PROMPT_SECTIONS be congruent with POM section semantics or even use the POM internally 
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî and that's a very strong architectural decision to make upfront.

üëâ PROMPT_SECTIONS should absolutely align 1:1 with POM semantics. In fact, it should use POM internally to ensure consistency, reusability, and compatibility across all prompt construction layers.

This decision has powerful implications:

‚úÖ Benefits of Making PROMPT_SECTIONS POM-Compatible
1. Predictability & Modularity
Developers and LLMs alike can rely on well-labeled sections like Personality, Goal, Instructions, Examples ‚Äî which map directly to a POM Section.

2. Zero-Conversion Overhead
If you already use a PROMPT_SECTIONS structure that mirrors POM fields:

{
  "title": "Goal",
  "body": "Help the user reset their password.",
  "bullets": ["Be patient", "Repeat back what they said"]
}
‚Ä¶ then you can plug it directly into a POM builder ‚Äî no transformations needed.

3. Unified Prompt Assembly Path
You avoid branching logic like: ‚ÄúIf raw string, do this; if partial-POM, transform it first; if POM, just use it.‚Äù
Everything becomes a normalized PomPrompt internally.

üß© Recommended Internal Model
Internally, AgentBase can maintain:

self._prompt_sections: List[POMSection] = []
Then add_instruction() or set_goal() append POM-compliant Section objects directly.

If PROMPT_SECTIONS is defined as a class attribute, during init:

Iterate over it

For each section, call self.add_section(section) or self.add_structured_prompt_section() internally

These can validate structure and handle standard section names like goal, instructions, examples

üìò Developer Example (Prefab)
PROMPT_SECTIONS = [
  {
    "title": "Personality",
    "body": "You are professional and reassuring."
  },
  {
    "title": "Goal",
    "body": "Help callers schedule a doctor's appointment."
  },
  {
    "title": "Instructions",
    "bullets": ["Confirm the caller‚Äôs name", "Ask for preferred date and time"]
  }
]
No need for set_*() methods unless the dev wants dynamic control.

You could still expose sugar methods like:

def set_goal(self, text: str):
    self.add_structured_prompt_section(title="Goal", body=text)
But these just construct and append to the same POM list.

üí° Option: Enum or Constants for Canonical Section Titles
To ensure consistency:

class PromptSections:
    PERSONALITY = "Personality"
    GOAL = "Goal"
    INSTRUCTIONS = "Instructions"
    EXAMPLES = "Examples"
    FALLBACK = "Fallback"
So prefab and dev-facing logic doesn‚Äôt introduce typos or duplicate labels.

üß† Final Model
PROMPT_SECTIONS: a list of valid POM section dictionaries

Internally stored as self._prompt_sections: List[POMSection]

Can be overridden dynamically via methods or declared statically

Ultimately rendered via PomPrompt.render() to YAML or Markdown for SWML

Would you like to draft what the add_structured_prompt_section() API would look like, or sketch a prefab that uses this declaratively?

You said:
now think about a way to abstract tools (function) so its easy to declare them from the code side with the declaration and handler in one expression and have it have helper methods for the proper response obj from SWAIG calls, when functions exist they will need to be able to be in the path of the web apps server, all access needs to have tokens for authentication etc too 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî you're now scoping out the SWAIG Function Layer, and you want to design it as:

A declarative + programmatic hybrid: define tools and handlers in one expression

A secure and isolated HTTP-accessible microservice system

A first-class component of every agent's logic

Let‚Äôs break this into a clean SwaigFunction abstraction that fits naturally into the agent framework.

üß± Goal: One-Line Declaration + Hooked Behavior
You want to support something like:

self.define_tool(
  name="lookup_user",
  description="Look up a user by ID.",
  parameters={"user_id": {"type": "string"}},
  handler=self.lookup_user
)
Or with a helper syntax:

@self.tool(name="lookup_user", parameters={"user_id": {"type": "string"}})
def lookup_user(self, user_id):
    return self.ok({"name": "Jane", "status": "Active"})
üîß Internal Representation: SwaigFunction
Attributes
class SwaigFunction:
    name: str
    description: str
    parameters: Dict[str, Any]  # JSON Schema-style
    handler: Callable[[**kwargs], Any]
    secure: bool = True  # Require token
    output_schema: Optional[Dict] = None
This can be stored in the agent like:

self._tools = {
  "lookup_user": SwaigFunction(...)
}
üîê Security Considerations
Each SWAIG endpoint (e.g., /tools/lookup_user) should:

Require a bearer token or API key

Be configurable via agent or global config

Validate requests before calling handler

Optionally log or audit tool use

We can support:

class AgentBase:
    def validate_token(self, token: str) -> bool:
        """Override or configure token check."""
Or set a shared AGENT_SECRET or per-tool token override.

ü§ñ Helper Response Methods
To make handlers easy to write and test:

def ok(self, result: Dict):
    """Standard response payload to return from handler."""
    return {
        "status": "ok",
        "result": result
    }

def fail(self, message: str, code: int = 400):
    return {
        "status": "error",
        "error": {
            "code": code,
            "message": message
        }
    }

def respond_with_swml(self, swml_obj: Dict):
    return {
        "status": "ok",
        "swml": swml_obj
    }
Each handler can return these dictionaries directly and the agent base class will HTTP-return them as JSON.

üì° Routing and Exposure
Each function gets its own path:

POST /<agent_route>/tools/<function_name>
Your AgentBase mounts these on startup:

@router.post("/tools/{function_name}")
def handle_tool(function_name: str):
    self.validate_token(request)
    self._tools[function_name].handler(**parsed_args)
üß† Bonus: Auto-doc / Schema Export
Each SwaigFunction can render its own JSON object for use in:

SWML SWAIG array

OpenAPI-style documentation

RAG indexing or tool inspection

def to_swaig(self):
    return {
        "function": self.name,
        "arguments": self.parameters,
        "request": {
            "url": f"{self.base_url}/tools/{self.name}",
            "method": "POST"
        },
        ...
    }
üåâ Unified Experience
So when you define a tool in your prefab or agent:

self.tool("check_balance", {"account_id": {"type": "string"}}, self.check_balance)
That one line:

Declares the function for SWML SWAIG

Installs a secure HTTP route

Registers the call handler

Enables testable response format helpers

Would you like to next map out the full SwaigFunction API or define the router logic for function mounting and token validation?

You said:
since the system is generating the swml as well as the swaig server it can make up its own auth tokens on demand to allow the URL to be authed, there will need to be a user:pass type basic auth model that needs to be specified on SW side to call the agent and get the SWML and then it can seed a temporary basic auth pass into the URLs it generates for the functions 
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî this is a powerful approach: since the agent is the authority for both the SWML and the SWAIG tool endpoints, it can generate secure, expirable credentials at runtime, embed them in the right places, and enforce them during execution.

This gives you full end-to-end control over authentication and exposure of AI behavior.

üîê Authentication Strategy Overview
üîπ 1. Inbound SWML Access Requires Basic Auth
SignalWire will fetch /agent_route using user:pass@url

You‚Äôll specify this in your SignalWire dashboard or resource config

Your agent will validate these credentials on every inbound request

post_prompt_url: https://user:pass@myserver.com/support/post_prompt
This is the entry point credential, and it authorizes access to the agent itself.

üîπ 2. SWAIG Tool Calls Use Temporary Tokens
When building the SWML, the agent generates a random pass (or HMAC/token)

This pass is embedded into all SWAIG function URLs in the request.url:

"request": {
  "url": "https://myserver.com/support/tools/lookup_user?token=abc123",
  "method": "POST"
}
When SignalWire‚Äôs AI kernel makes a tool call, it uses that token

The agent validates it before dispatching to the function handler

These tokens are generated at SWML time, scoped to the current execution, and may expire or be one-time-use depending on your security policy.

üîß Token & Auth Handling in AgentBase
Configuration:
self._auth_config = {
    "basic_user": "support",
    "basic_pass": "s3cret",
    "tool_tokens": {}  # name ‚Üí token
}
During render_swml():
token = self._generate_token(function_name)
self._auth_config["tool_tokens"][function_name] = token

tool_url = f"https://{self.route}/tools/{function_name}?token={token}"
In function route handler:
def handle_tool(function_name):
    token = request.query_params.get("token")
    if not self._validate_tool_token(function_name, token):
        return JSONResponse({"error": "unauthorized"}, status_code=401)
    ...
‚úçÔ∏è Declarative API for Agents
agent = MyAgent(
  name="support",
  route="/support",
  basic_auth=("user", "pass"),  # Used by SW to access SWML and post_prompt
  tool_auth="generated",        # Tells it to auto-generate tool tokens
)
Or let it auto-generate the basic user/pass too and return them for printing/logging:

user, password = agent.get_basic_auth_credentials()
üõ† Token Generation Helpers
Use UUID, HMAC, or random string:

def _generate_token(self, name):
    return secrets.token_urlsafe(24)
You could optionally:

Set expiry times

Rotate tokens per call/session

Hash + verify tokens with HMAC for stateless validation

üì° Example Output in SWML
ai:
  post_prompt_url: https://user:pass@server.com/support/post_prompt
  SWAIG:
    - function: "lookup_user"
      arguments:
        user_id: { type: string }
      request:
        url: https://server.com/support/tools/lookup_user?token=abc123
        method: POST
Everything is self-contained, ephemeral, and locked down ‚Äî no static secrets exposed.

Would you like to sketch out the function that injects these signed URLs into the SWAIG block during SWML rendering next? Or focus on the token lifecycle and revocation logic?

You said:
The server will have to track active calls so the lifecycle should probably be the duration of the call, we have 2 special SWAIG functions called startup_hook and hangup_hook that are guaranteed to be called so we can use that to tell when to expire the token 
ChatGPT said:
Exactly ‚Äî this fits beautifully into a call-scoped session model, where each call gets its own temporary auth context, and its lifecycle is bound to the start and end of the call via startup_hook and hangup_hook.

You're effectively building a per-call security sandbox for each agent instance.

üîÑ Lifecycle-Scoped Token Management
üîπ At a Glance
Stage	Behavior
SWML served	Agent generates a new call_session_id and per-tool tokens
startup_hook called	Session becomes "active" ‚Äî tokens are considered valid
During call	SWAIG functions validate tokens using session context
hangup_hook called	Session and all tokens are invalidated immediately
üß± Data Structure: Per-Call Session Tracking
class AgentBase:
    self._active_calls = {
        "<call_id>": {
            "tokens": {
                "lookup_user": "abc123",
                "get_ticket": "xyz789"
            },
            "started_at": datetime,
            "state": "active"  # or "pending", "expired"
        }
    }
This lets you:

Track sessions per call_id

Invalidate sessions on hangup

Enforce single-use or expiring tokens

üîë Token Generation + Injection (in render_swml())
def _render_swml(self, call_id):
    session = self._active_calls[call_id] = {
        "tokens": {},
        "state": "pending",
        "started_at": datetime.now()
    }

    for tool in self._tools:
        token = self._generate_token()
        session["tokens"][tool.name] = token

        tool_url = f"{self.base_url}/tools/{tool.name}?token={token}&call_id={call_id}"
        ...
Each SWML response is now tied to a call_id, and all tool URLs include that and a per-function token.

üîí Validation Logic
When a SWAIG tool is called:

def handle_tool(function_name):
    token = request.query_params.get("token")
    call_id = request.query_params.get("call_id")

    session = self._active_calls.get(call_id)
    if not session or session["state"] != "active":
        return unauthorized

    if session["tokens"].get(function_name) != token:
        return unauthorized

    # Proceed with function
üöÄ Handling startup_hook and hangup_hook
startup_hook:
def handle_tool("startup_hook"):
    call_id = request.query_params["call_id"]
    self._active_calls[call_id]["state"] = "active"
hangup_hook:
def handle_tool("hangup_hook"):
    call_id = request.query_params["call_id"]
    self._active_calls.pop(call_id, None)  # Delete session and tokens
üîß Bonus: Agent Config Option
To make this feature toggleable:

agent = MyAgent(
    per_call_sessions=True,
    token_expiry_secs=300
)
Could be enforced with:

Timed cleanup via background task

Session expiry logic on request

üìà Benefits
Zero static secrets

One-click security for every tool call

Fully ephemeral per-call state

Easy to test, easy to rotate

Would you like to formalize the CallSessionManager class next to encapsulate this logic cleanly, or define how tool_url and SWAIG output serialization work with this model?

You said:
functions in SWAIG have some specific data that is posted that can be collected and saved and have a specific response format we can define a special function result class to manage that object, it includes a response string and an array of objects that are called actions, which we can get into later but it could have methods to add the response prompt and/or actions 
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî and this is an ideal use case for a SwaigFunctionResult class ‚Äî a formal, composable object that encapsulates the output of any SWAIG function call, including:

‚úÖ A natural language response (what the bot says back)

‚úÖ A structured list of actions (SWML-influencing directives)

üß© Optional data you want to save (e.g., logging, tracing, result caching)

You're defining a clean abstraction over the SWAIG function return payload, which lets developers build rich responses without worrying about low-level dict construction.

üß± SwaigFunctionResult: Purpose and Structure
Expected by SWML/SWAIG:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "result": {
    "response": "I found your order. It's being delivered tomorrow.",
    "actions": [
      { "type": "play", "url": "say:Your order is on the way." },
      { "type": "transfer", "dest": "shipping_support" }
    ]
  }
}
This is what your helper class should produce with one line of code.

üîß Class Design: SwaigFunctionResult
class SwaigFunctionResult:
    def __init__(self, response: Optional[str] = None):
        self.response = response or ""
        self.actions: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []

    def add_action(self, action_type: str, **kwargs) -> 'SwaigFunctionResult':
        """Add a structured action to the response."""
        self.actions.append({ "type": action_type, **kwargs })
        return self  # Enables method chaining

    def set_response(self, response: str) -> 'SwaigFunctionResult':
        """Update the natural language response."""
        self.response = response
        return self

    def to_dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Render the full JSON payload expected by SWAIG."""
        return {
            "status": "ok",
            "result": {
                "response": self.response,
                "actions": self.actions
            }
        }
‚úÖ Developer Usage
Simple example:

return SwaigFunctionResult("Got it. I‚Äôve canceled your appointment.")
With actions:

return (
  SwaigFunctionResult("I'm transferring you to billing.")
  .add_action("transfer", dest="billing")
)
Add a voice + SMS message:

result = SwaigFunctionResult()
result.set_response("Here's your balance.")
result.add_action("play", url="say:Your balance is $12.")
result.add_action("send_sms", to="%{call.from}", message="Your balance is $12.")
return result
üß© Future-Proofing: Action Schema
Later, you can define a formal schema or enum for allowed action types:

class SwaigActionTypes:
    PLAY = "play"
    TRANSFER = "transfer"
    SEND_SMS = "send_sms"
    JOIN_ROOM = "join_room"
    RETURN = "return"
And validate actions accordingly in add_action().

üîÑ Integration in Agent Framework
AgentBase or ToolExecutor accepts a SwaigFunctionResult, serializes it via .to_dict(), and returns JSON.

Optional: wrap this behind a @tool decorator that auto-wraps string or dicts into a result object.

Would you like to define the action schema next (what types, required fields, etc.) or work out how to auto-wrap return values inside tool handlers using a decorator?

lets review the things the base class provides so far 
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely ‚Äî here‚Äôs a comprehensive snapshot of what we've defined and proposed for the AgentBase class so far. This summary includes its core architecture, responsibilities, and the building blocks it exposes to higher layers like prefabs and custom agents.

üß± AgentBase Summary
The AgentBase class is a foundational superclass for all SignalWire AI agents, functioning as both:

A SWML generator

A self-hosted web app

A SWAIG tool server

A per-call session manager

üîß 1. Core Initialization & Configuration
__init__(
    name: str,
    route: str,
    host: str = "0.0.0.0",
    port: int = 3000,
    basic_auth: Tuple[str, str] = None,
    use_pom: bool = True,
    per_call_sessions: bool = True,
    token_expiry_secs: int = 600
)
Fields initialized:

Agent name and routing path

Basic auth credentials (for /, /post_prompt)

Tool token policy (ephemeral, per-call)

Internal POM section list (_prompt_sections)

Tool registry (_tools)

Active call tracking (_active_calls)

üìã 2. Prompt Construction Methods
Setters and section builders
set_prompt_text(text: str)
set_prompt_pom(pom_obj: List[Dict])
add_structured_prompt_section(title: str, body: str = None, bullets: List[str] = None)
set_goal(body: str)
set_personality(text: str)
add_instruction(bullet: str)
add_example(title: str, body: str)
Internal
_build_prompt() -> PomPrompt
These allow prefab and manual agents to construct modular POM-based prompts, or override them entirely.

üß∞ 3. SWAIG Tool System
Tool declaration
define_tool(name: str, description: str, parameters: Dict, handler: Callable)
Tool registration via decorator
@tool(name="lookup_user", parameters={"user_id": {"type": "string"}})
def lookup_user(self, user_id): ...
Tool response utility
return (
  SwaigFunctionResult("Here you go.")
  .add_action("play", url="say:Here's the info.")
  .add_action("transfer", dest="support")
)
SwaigFunctionResult.to_dict() returns proper response payload

Tokenized tool URLs are injected into the SWML at generation time

üîê 4. Security + Token Management
Each call gets a temporary call_id-scoped session

startup_hook marks session as active

hangup_hook expires session and tokens

Tool URLs include token and call ID:

/tools/get_info?token=abc123&call_id=xyz
Auth enforced:

Basic Auth for / and /post_prompt

Token for /tools/* routes

üñ•Ô∏è 5. Web Server Integration
Agent-as-Service
agent.serve(ip="0.0.0.0", port=3000)
Router for shared server
router = agent.as_router()
Endpoints:

Path	Purpose
/	Serve SWML
/post_prompt	Handle post_prompt_url
/tools/<name>	Handle tool call with token validation
Hooks: /tools/startup_hook and /tools/hangup_hook	
üß† 6. Hooks for Extensibility
def get_prompt(self) -> Union[str, PomPrompt]
def define_tools(self) -> List[SwaigFunction]
def get_post_prompt(self) -> Optional[str]
def on_summary(self, summary: Dict) -> None
def on_function_call(self, name: str, args: Dict) -> Any
def validate_token(self, token: str) -> bool  # or per-call override
All of these can be overridden or extended by subclasses.

üì¶ Ready for Prefabs
The structure supports prefab layers like InfoGathererAgent or SurveyAgent by providing:

Declarative PROMPT_SECTIONS

fields ‚Üí POM transformation

summary_format ‚Üí post_prompt template builder

Auto-registration of tools and actions

Would you like to now:

Formalize the list of action types supported by SwaigFunctionResult?

Draft a sample base router implementation with auth and dispatch?

Or dive into how prefabs could layer over this?

actions are documented here

ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî and this is an ideal use case for a SwaigFunctionResult class ‚Äî a formal, composable object that encapsulates the output of any SWAIG function call, including:

‚úÖ A natural language response (what the bot says back)

‚úÖ A structured list of actions (SWML-influencing directives)

üß© Optional data you want to save (e.g., logging, tracing, result caching)

You're defining a clean abstraction over the SWAIG function return payload, which lets developers build rich responses without worrying about low-level dict construction.

üß± SwaigFunctionResult: Purpose and Structure
Expected by SWML/SWAIG:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "result": {
    "response": "I found your order. It's being delivered tomorrow.",
    "action": [
      { "type": "play", "url": "say:Your order is on the way." },
      { "type": "transfer", "dest": "shipping_support" }
    ]
  }
}
This is what your helper class should produce with one line of code.

üîß Class Design: SwaigFunctionResult
class SwaigFunctionResult:
    def __init__(self, response: Optional[str] = None):
        self.response = response or ""
        self.actions: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []

    def add_action(self, action_type: str, **kwargs) -> 'SwaigFunctionResult':
        """Add a structured action to the response."""
        self.actions.append({ "type": action_type, **kwargs })
        return self  # Enables method chaining

    def set_response(self, response: str) -> 'SwaigFunctionResult':
        """Update the natural language response."""
        self.response = response
        return self

    def to_dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Render the full JSON payload expected by SWAIG."""
        return {
            "status": "ok",
            "result": {
                "response": self.response,
                "action": self.actions
            }
        }
‚úÖ Developer Usage
Simple example:

return SwaigFunctionResult("Got it. I‚Äôve canceled your appointment.")
With actions:

return (
  SwaigFunctionResult("I'm transferring you to billing.")
  .add_action("transfer", dest="billing")
)
Add a voice + SMS message:

result = SwaigFunctionResult()
result.set_response("Here's your balance.")
result.add_action("play", url="say:Your balance is $12.")
result.add_action("send_sms", to="%{call.from}", message="Your balance is $12.")
return result
üß© Future-Proofing: Action Schema
Later, you can define a formal schema or enum for allowed action types:

class SwaigActionTypes:
    PLAY = "play"
    TRANSFER = "transfer"
    SEND_SMS = "send_sms"
    JOIN_ROOM = "join_room"
    RETURN = "return"
And validate actions accordingly in add_action().
